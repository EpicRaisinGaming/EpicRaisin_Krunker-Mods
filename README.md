## How to Import Mods into Krunker
Open Krunker and hit 'Mods'. Press 'Load Mod' at the top, and drag n' drop the .zip file into the box OR click the box and navigate to the location you saved the .zip file to (defaults to Downloads on Windows) and select it and hit Open. After that, you're good to go, no refresh needed! (You might need to wait awhile depending on the size of the mod.)
